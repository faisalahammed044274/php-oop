<!-- Encapsulation is just a concept in PHP OOP.

Encapsulation tells you how to organize your classes and enhance your code and its security.

As we have already seen a class is composed of properties and methods.

Using encapsulation, we are hiding the real implementation of data from the user and also does not allow anyone to manipulate data members except by calling the desired operation.

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

We have data encapsulation when we encapsulate the data, when we hide them. And this can be achieved by hiding the properties and making them accessible only via methods.

An example would be marking the properties as private so as not to be accessible from outside the class and manipulating them using public getters and setters methods as we have seen in previous lessons. So here is very important the right use of access modifiers

The wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit (called class) is known as encapsulation. Encapsulation is a protection mechanism for the data members and methods present inside the class. In the encapsulation technique, we are restricting the data members from access to outside world end-user. -->
