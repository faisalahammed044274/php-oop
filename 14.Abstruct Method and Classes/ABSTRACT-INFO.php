// Abstract class is a class from which we do not want to create an object. We only want to access its methods.

// A class is called abstract when it has at least one abstract method.

// Abstract methods must be defined in the child class.

// We can not create an instance of an abstract class


// Interface are similar to abstract classes. The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are:

// 1) Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can

// 2) All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected

// 3) All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary

// 4) Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time
